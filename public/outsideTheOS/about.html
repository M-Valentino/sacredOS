      Intro
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sacred OS is an operating system that runs in your web browser and is written in vanilla JavaScript. Sacred OS
      uses a bootloader so you can use the OS with your saved
      settings, programs, files, etc. Sacred OS is inspired by operating systems from the Windows 9x era. It is
      open source, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/M-Valentino/sacredOS">
        the code can be found here</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-it-works">
      How it works
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sacred OS runs off a JavaScript object which is essentially the "hard disk". The GUI, the kernel, programs,
      and more are all stored here. The bootloader writes to this object either by uploading a disk backup or by
      fetching all the necessary files and storing them (what happens when you boot from a fresh install).
    </p>
    <p>
      In Sacred OS, HTML files are executable. When you execute an HTML file, it is loaded into a window which
      contains an iframe of the HTML file. These HTML files can communicate with the kernel, such as requesting
      the system's main style sheet or writing to the disk. Communication to the kernel from program iframes is
      accomplished through the <code>window.postMessage()</code> method.

    <p>
      File manipulation is limited at the moment in Sacred OS. Currently you can't rename folders or do cut and paste
      operations, but I'm working on it. I'm also working on a way to let users update their saved JSON disk backups to
      the latest OS version.

    <h2 id="qa">Q&A</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Q:</strong> What inspired you to make Sacred OS?
      <br />
      <strong>A:</strong> <a href="https://dustinbrett.com/">Daedal OS</a> actually inspired me. I thought it was really
      incredible that a Windows 10-like desktop environment could be coded inside a webpage. I saw that it was recieving
      a lot of attention and thought, "hmmm, I can do that too and put it on my resume". I didn't want to totally copy
      what Dustin Brett did, and I thought I could possibly do what he did but better in some ways. So I came up with
      the idea to make a retro Windows inspired operating system written with vanilla JavaScript that would allow you do
      save and backup your data more easily. I chose to use Vanilla JS as opposed to a framework because it would allow
      me to have more access to low level features in JavaScript, giving me more code control, and potentially more
      performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Q:</strong> Are there file size limits for the JSON disk backups and the virtual hard drive?
      <br />
      <strong>A:</strong> Yes, and they are determined by the browser. The virtual hard drive is a JavaScript object. I
      can't find much information on how large an object can be in the main modern browsers, but a developer forum for
      <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/42211664">Chromium has a post from 2010 saying Chromium has a limit of
        2GB</a>. I can't find anything on the max size for saving files in JavaScript either, but I wouldn't be suprised
      if such a limit existed, it would be at least 1GB for Firefox and Chrome. For saving anything to local storage,
      the limit in most browsers is 5MiB, but Firefox and Chrome allow users to increase the limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Q:</strong> Why is orange the main color of Sacred OS?
      <br />
      <strong>A:</strong> Its my favorite color 😁.
